Dataset sources from kaggle link above.
Note this an example of transfer learning in ai.
You need to build the gnet net from deep network builder in matlab by replacing the 
last output layer and then loss classifier function.
set the output size of the loss classifier replacee fully connected network to 7 representing 7 classifications
